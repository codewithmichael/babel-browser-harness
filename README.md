BBH ♥ Hello
===========

The Babel Browser Harness (BBH) is a simple CDN-based HTML/JS jig that provides
in-browser ECMAScript transpiling via Babel.

In other words, it's a quick way to spin up a single-file ES2015+ sandbox
without worrying about Webpack, Browserify, Gulp, Grunt, etc.

You don't even need a web server if you keep your script in the same file—e.g.
```html
<script type="text/babel">
  console.log("Hello, World!")
</script>
```

If you would like to load external scripts (web server required):
```html
<script type="text/babel" src="./myscript.js"></script>
```

**Note:** If you have Python installed (most Linux + Mac users), you can fire up
a simple web server from a terminal in the current directory with the command:
```sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Installation
------------
Download the BBH `index.html` file and open it in a web browser.

After a couple of seconds, happiness should appear in your browser:
```
BBH ♥ Hello
```

If it does not, you are running an unsupported and unhappy browser.

*(BBH is primarily developed and tested using up-to-date Google Chrome)*

Libraries + Options
-------------------
BBH also includes a few commonly used libraries and transpiler options
which can be enabled by uncommenting them in the HTML/JS source.

React/JSX is enabled by default, but can be disabled.

Additional Libraries
--------------------
You can, of course, add additional libraries to import (from CDN or otherwise)
under the `IMPORTS` section.

If you do, and you don't want them running in the global scope (window), update
the `MAPPING` script (located below `IMPORTS`) to contain your preferred library
name and the globally scoped variable generated by the included library.

The name will be used for future `import` statements, and, by default, the
global variable name will automatically be removed from the global scope. If
this causes any problems, you may disable the global variable removal by adding
`false` as a third entry in you `MAPPING` list.

***Import Mapping Example***
```js
[ // Format: import_name, window_variable, [delete_from_window = true]
  ...
  ['jquery', 'jQuery', false],
  ...
]
```

Import / Export
---------------

All `<script type="text/babel">` scripts run within their own lexical scope.

If `export` statements are used, they may be loaded as modules within each
other, as long as either a `name` or `src` attribute are defined on the `script`
tag.

***Example***
```html
<script type="text/babel" name="greeter">
  export function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!")
  }
</script>

<script type="text/babel">
  import { sayHello } from 'greeter'
  sayHello()
</script>
```

If you're using a simple web server, you may prefer to store your modules
externally and use the source file's path.

***greeter.js***
```js
export function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!")
}
```

***index.html***
```html
...
<script type="text/babel" src="./greeter.js"></script>

<script type="text/babel">
  import { sayHello } from './greeter.js'
  sayHello()
</script>
...
```

For external files, you may also use the `name` attribute to override the `src`
path. This practice is encouraged, as it enables more standard `import`
notations, eliminates path formatting restrictions, and allows for mocking
packaged modules

***Example***
```html
<script type="text/babel" name="./greeter" src="./long/path/to/my_greeter.js"></script>

<script type="text/babel">
  import { sayHello } from './greeter'
  sayHello()
</script>

<script type="text/babel" name="test-module" src="./node_modules/some_es6_module/index.js"></script>

<script type="text/babel">
  import TestModule from 'test-module'
  TestModule.doSomething()
</script>
```

**CAVEAT:** Circular module dependencies are not presently supported, and
dependent scripts must be loaded in the correct order. *This is expected to
change!*
